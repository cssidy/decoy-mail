# Doppelganger Mail
#### Diverting today's spam, preventing tomorrow's spam.



### What issue does Doppelganger Mail address?

Email spam clogs up the Internet's functioning making mail servers have to process a bulk of content that nobody wants. This results in wasted electricity and physical storage for ISPs and, for the end user, time wasted being annoyed and having to further filter spam, empty spam boxes, and the risk of falling prey to malicious, unintentionally downloaded software and financial scams. The Internet would be a healthier organism without spam, why not build intelligent software agents to function as a protective immune system for it.

### What is the solution?

Doppelganger Mail is spam filtering and prevention software for email-clients. Doppelganger Mail first removes spam using Bayesian statistical filtering. Doppelganger Mail then prevents spam by employing autonomous, distributed, and intelligent software agents to engage with spammers and flood their servers with convincingly gullible (but false) leads and DoS attacks to their websites. Ultimately, this wastes spammers' time, induces spammer frustration, reduces spammers' motivation to spam, and render careers in spamming unprofitable to pursue. Thus, using Doppelganger Mail helps the world overcome spam.

### Why?

At this point in time we have systems that are very good at recognizing spam. However, most spam-fighting methods in use today are passive in comparison to Doppelganger Mail's approach; they rely on filtering to remove spam mail that has already been successfully delivered. This keeps us from seeing spam, but the spam keeps coming. They don't stop the root motivation: that those couple measly emails, 15 per million [Paul Graham proposes](http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html), will slip through the filters and hook a gullible victim. Doppelganger Mail takes it a step further: what happens if we shift those odds...say, 30 gullible, very "human" victims respond? Or 100? Or 300? or 100,000? How will the spammer know who to pursue? They will become confused, frustrated, and exhausted. There will be no reason to spam anymore because it will take more time and energy to find the victim than it's worth.

### About this software
  
I hope that this software spurs research into more innovative, effective ways of combating spam.
