It's like a lichen; a symbiotic relationship between hardware, software, information and humans. Spam clogs up its functioning, making servers have to process a bulk of data that nobody wants. This results in wasted electricity and physical storage for ISPs and, for the end user, time wasted being annoyed and having to further filter spam, empty spam boxes, and the risk of falling prey to malicious, unintentionally downloaded software and scams. The Internet would be a healthier organism without spam, and now we can build intelligent software agents to function as a protective immune system for it.\r\n\r\n### What is the solution?\r\n\r\nDecoy Mail is spam prevention software for ISP's mailservers and email-clients. Decoy Mail prevents spam by employing autonomous, distributed, and intelligent software agents to engage with spammers and flood their servers with convincingly gullible (but false) leads. Ultimately, this wastes spammers' time, induces spammer frustration, reduces spammers' motivation to spam, and render careers in spamming unprofitable to pursue. Decoy Mail prevents future spam.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nAt this point in time we have systems that are very good at recognizing spam. However, most spam-fighting methods in use today are passive in comparison to Decoy Mail's approach; they rely on Bayesian filtering to remove spam mail that has already been successfully delivered. This is inefficient because it doesn't stop the root motivation, that 5 out of 100,000 emails (that take only an hour, maybe $100 and little thought to send) will slip through the statistical filters and hook a gullible victim and their credit card. Sad but true, that's pretty good odds of success for such a small investment. Shell takes it a step further: what happens if we shift those odds...say, 30 gullible, very \"human\" victims respond? Or 100? Or 300? or 100,000? How will the spammer know who to pursue? They will become confused, frustrated, and exhausted. There will be no reason to spam anymore because it will take more time and energy to find the victim than it's worth.\r\n\r\n### About this software\r\n  \r\nAttempting to fund this sort of project would prolong its completion because I do not have the resources to build a company to develop it. And, after the hypothetical company is formed, there are no guarantees that I'd make my investment back. So, instead of being secretive with my ideas and proof-of-concept, I feel it's more beneficial to release it into the wild and see what happens. This is the sort of code that is for the public good, anyways. I hope that it spurs research into more innovative, effective ways of combating spam.\r\n  \r\nWhat happens if spammers see this and device more innovative, effective ways of countering Decoy Mail? That could happen. But those spammer could also, in effect, show how to make the Decoy Mail software more robust and more \"human\". Because of the very nature of spam and its mediums, there still has to be someone on the other end who decides if the victim is worth pursuing and attempt to get money/personally identifiable information from them. I'm not sure yet how a spammer will be able to circumvent that. Maybe spammers will create bots to antagonize Decoy Mail's bots, but what good would that do in getting them closer to their objective? At least it will give them something to do besides sending out mass emails.\r\n",
