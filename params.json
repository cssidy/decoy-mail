It's like a lichen; a symbiotic relationship between hardware, software, information and humans. Spam clogs up its functioning, making servers have to process a bulk of data that nobody wants. This results in wasted electricity and physical storage for ISPs and, for the end user, time wasted being annoyed and having to further filter spam, empty spam boxes, and the risk of falling prey to malicious, unintentionally downloaded software and scams. The Internet would be a healthier organism without spam, and now we can build intelligent software agents to function as a protective immune system for it.\r\n\r\n### What is the solution?\r\n\r\nDoppelganger Mail is spam filtering and prevention software for email-clients (and potentially ISP's). Doppelganger Mail removes spam using highly accurate Bayesian statistical filtering. Doppelganger Mail prevents spam by employing autonomous, distributed, and intelligent software agents to engage with spammers and flood their servers with convincingly gullible (but false) leads and DoS attacks to their websites. Ultimately, this wastes spammers' time, induces spammer frustration, reduces spammers' motivation to spam, and render careers in spamming unprofitable to pursue. Thus, using Doppelganger Mail helps the world overcome spam.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\n\r\nAt this point in time we have systems that are very good at recognizing spam. However, most spam-fighting methods in use today are passive in comparison to Doppelganger Mail's approach; they rely on filtering to remove spam mail that has already been successfully delivered. This is inefficient because it doesn't stop the root motivation, that those couple measly emails (maybe 5 out of 100,000 [I need a source here]) will slip through the filters and hook a gullible victim and their credit card. Sad but true, that's pretty good odds of success for such a small investment. Doppelganger Mail takes it a step further: what happens if we shift those odds...say, 30 gullible, very \"human\" victims respond? Or 100? Or 300? or 100,000? How will the spammer know who to pursue? They will become confused, frustrated, and exhausted. There will be no reason to spam anymore because it will take more time and energy to find the victim than it's worth.\r\n\r\n### About this software\r\n  \r\nI hope that this software spurs research into more innovative, effective ways of combating spam.\r\n  \r\nWhat happens if spammers see this and device more innovative, effective ways of countering Doppelganger Mail? That could happen. But those spammer could also, in effect, show how to make the Doppelganger Mail software more robust and more \"human\". Because of the very nature of spam and its mediums, there still has to be someone on the other end who decides if the victim is worth pursuing and attempt to get money/personally identifiable information from them. I'm not sure yet how a spammer will be able to circumvent that. Maybe spammers will create bots to antagonize Doppelganger Mail's bots, but what good would that do in getting them closer to their objective? At least it will give them something to do besides sending out mass emails.\r\n",
