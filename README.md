### Configuration & Usage

Note: Doppelganger Mail is written in Python 3.5. This version is designed to work with a Gmail inbox.
It requires an Internet connection and Gmail account and credentials to run. You will have to
[turn off 2-Step Verification](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1064203?hl=en) to allow the
email bot to access your Inbox, otherwise Google will block the action. I am trying to avoid 3rd party
libraries/APIs as much as possible. Eventually this software will have to be tailored to run on
diverse systems, Thunderbird, Outlook, etc. Hence, I am not using solely Google's Gmail API.
