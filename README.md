# Shell
## Playing the shell game with email spammers. Preventing future spam.

### What issue does Shell address?

### What is the solution?

### Video demonstration

### Program flow chart

### Why is this open source?

Attempting to fund this sort of project would prolong its completion because I do not have the resources to build a company to develop it. And, after the hypothetical company is formed, there are no guarantees that I'd make my investment back. So, instead of being selfish and secretive with my ideas and proof-of-concept, I feel it's more beneficial to release it into the wild and see what happens.

The best I could hope for is that it spurs new thoughts and research into more innovative, effective ways of combating spam. The worst I can envision is that email spammers will read this documentation and devise their own more innovative, effective counter attacks. 

Ultimately, I feel conviction behind what I want to build, and I need to be part of a community that will help me accelerate the project. Having this project public will allow me to easily talk about it amongst others, remedy mistakes, and be exposed to new programming techniques.
