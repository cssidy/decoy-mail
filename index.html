<p>Imagine the Internet as a living organism. It's like a lichen; a symbiotic relationship between hardware, software, information and humans. Spam clogs up its functioning, making servers have to process a bulk of data that nobody wants. This results in wasted electricity and physical storage for ISPs and, for the end user, time wasted being annoyed and having to further filter spam, empty spam boxes, and the risk of falling prey to malicious, unintentionally downloaded software and scams. The Internet would be a healthier organism without spam, and now we can build intelligent software agents to function as a protective immune system for it.</p>

<h3>
<a id="what-is-the-solution" class="anchor" href="#what-is-the-solution" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is the solution?</h3>

<p>Decoy Mail is spam prevention software for ISP's mailservers and email-clients. Decoy Mail prevents spam by employing autonomous, distributed, and intelligent software agents to engage with spammers and flood their servers with convincingly gullible (but false) leads. Ultimately, this wastes spammers' time, induces spammer frustration, reduces spammers' motivation to spam, and render careers in spamming unprofitable to pursue. Decoy Mail prevents future spam.</p>

<h3>
<a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?</h3>

<p>At this point in time we have systems that are very good at recognizing spam. However, most spam-fighting methods in use today are passive in comparison to Decoy Mail's approach; they rely on Bayesian filtering to remove spam mail that has already been successfully delivered. This is inefficient because it doesn't stop the root motivation, that 5 out of 100,000 emails (that take only an hour, maybe $100 and little thought to send) will slip through the statistical filters and hook a gullible victim and their credit card. Sad but true, that's pretty good odds of success for such a small investment. Shell takes it a step further: what happens if we shift those odds...say, 30 gullible, very "human" victims respond? Or 100? Or 300? or 100,000? How will the spammer know who to pursue? They will become confused, frustrated, and exhausted. There will be no reason to spam anymore because it will take more time and energy to find the victim than it's worth.</p>

<a id="about-this-software" class="anchor" href="#about-this-software" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About this software</h3>

<p>Decoy Mail is written in Python 3.5 with PyCharm Community Edition. This version is designed to log into Gmail mail servers. It requires an Internet connection and Gmail account and credentials to run. I am trying to avoid 3rd party libraries/APIs as much as possible. Eventually this software will have to be tailored to run on diverse systems, communicating with other diverse systems with their own unique configurations (which may be different than Google's).</p>

<p>This proof of concept logs into a Gmail account, enters the inbox, starting at the first email looks through the list, fetches the first email it finds with a spam keyword, then composes and sends a new email to the sender of the spam.</p>
